## What & Why
The ultimate goal of any person learning a language is to eventually never need a translator ever again, and as language students ourselves we know all too well how tedious and often blantly wrong services like Google Translate can be. While copying some text, opening up Google Translate in a new tab and pasting it in for a semi-acurate translate is good enough for some people, many of us aren't okay with settling with such a service.

When it comes to translation APIs, each one out there is unique. Some may be better at short phrases and individual words, while others require more context but are more adept at complex passages. With linguini, not only can you get the best of both worlds, comparing and contrasting mutliple translation services, but you get unparalleled convenience.

By balancing multiple translations, linguini gets at the heart of learning lanuage. It doesn't just give you one answer, it lets you read multiple interpretations in order to help you more fully understand what you are reading.
