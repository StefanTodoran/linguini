### What & Why
The ultimate goal of any person learning a language is to eventually never need a translator ever again. 
As language students ourselves we know all too well how tedious and often blantly wrong services like Google Translate can be. While copying some text, opening up Google Translate in a new tab and pasting for a semi-acurate translation is good enough for some people, many of us aren't okay with settling with such a service.

When it comes to translation APIs, each one out there is unique. Some may be better at short phrases and individual words, while others require more context but are more adept at complex passages. With linguini, not only can you get the best of both worlds, comparing and contrasting mutliple translation services, but you get unparalleled convenience.

In the example above, the correct literal translation would be
```
Are they going to give you the role in the movie?
```
This would make Microsoft's translation more accurate.
However, Google's translation might be considered more elegant, conveying the same meaning in a way that is more accurate to how a native english speaker would speak.

By balancing multiple translations, linguini gets at the heart of language learning. It doesn't just give you one answer, it lets you read multiple interpretations in order to help you more fully understand what you are reading, and allow you to adapt and advance.

### TL;DR
Linguini is a browser extension designed to help you translate words and phrases at the press of a button. Its sleek, low-profile interface seamlessly integrates into chrome; you won't notice it when you don't need to use it. Created with language learners in mind, linguini offers multiple translations to help users find deeper understanding and assist learning.

### Features
* Translate instantly at the push of a button
* Support for more than 70+ languages
* Get translations from multiple translation APIs
* Lightweight, takes up less than 200 KiB

### Plans for the Future
At the moment, linguini only supports showing translations from Microsoft translate and Google translate. However, there are far more options out there than just these two, some of which are far better than the big two (see DeepL Translate). Adding more translations to linguini is the most crucial step in improving the service, and is something we will continue to work on into the future. UX improvements are also in the works, as well as improvements to security.
